# Institutional Personnel and Asset Integrated Management System

**Abbreviated as IPAIMS**

There is a universal demand across various organizations, institutions, schools, companies, etc., for unified management of personnel and assets, as well as a need for information disclosure. However, there hasn't been a practical, aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, open-source, and fully secure system available for use. Hence, this system is proposed.

This system consists of a generic version, an exclusive version for specific institutions, and a central control version. The exclusive version inherits all the functionalities of the generic version and incorporates exclusive modifications and features based on specific requirements. The central control version can link multiple generic and exclusive versions to facilitate unified and coherent management.

The system supports distributed deployment, allowing individual sub-organizations to establish their required systems. Moreover, the main organization can create necessary systems and a central control system, which, after relevant configurations in the central control system, can be used efficiently.

Users can choose to activate or deactivate various functional sub-items within the system. Response-oriented services feature a cache mechanism based on feature codes to handle high concurrent access. All communication affecting data in the system employs dual-key communication, utilizing the ED25519 algorithm. Administrative personnel should configure physical keys or TOTP for two-factor authentication.

### IPAIMS Universal

The operational principle of integrated management functions comprises two major modules: the static module and the temporal module.
The static module is responsible for storing personnel information and asset data.
The temporal module, based on the static module, organizes sequential storage based on time, resembling logs, and generates relevant statistical data based on temporal data.

Contents stored in the static module include: Permission Groups, Personnel Status Table, Personnel Group Table, Personnel Basic Information, Asset Status Table, Asset Group Table, Asset Usage Table, Asset Basic Information, and Static Chain.

- Permission Groups: To appropriately distribute management permissions, there are permission groups. Administrative personnel can create multiple permission groups and add permission nodes within them.
- Personnel Status Table: To clearly understand the current status of personnel, there's a table for personnel statuses. Administrative personnel can define various personnel statuses such as active, on leave, sick leave, etc.
- Personnel Group Table: For batch management of personnel, there's a table for personnel groups. Administrative personnel can create personnel groups, add individuals to these groups, and manage these groups collectively, reflecting on all individuals within the group.
- Personnel Basic Information: This section stores all personnel information, allowing administrative personnel to customize stored fields and configure temporal fields. Status, permission groups, and personnel groups are linked as indices.
- Asset Status Table: For clarity on asset status, there's an asset status table. Administrative personnel can define multiple asset statuses, such as operational, under maintenance, closed, etc.
- Asset Group Table: For batch management of assets, there's an asset group table. Administrative personnel can create asset groups, add assets to these groups, and manage these groups collectively, reflecting on all assets within the group.
- Asset Usage Table: To clearly record and statistically analyze temporal data, there's an asset usage table. Administrative personnel can set asset usages, such as attendance terminals, configure log formats, storage formats, and subsequently, the system generates corresponding APIs for access.
- Asset Basic Information: This section stores all asset information, allowing administrative personnel to customize stored fields and configure temporal fields. Status, asset groups, and asset usages are linked as indices.
- Temporal Fields: These fields assist in statistical and processing-related tasks in conjunction with the temporal module. Administrative personnel can configure temporal cycles, temporal logics, and temporal field names.
- Temporal Cycles: The cycle for temporal storage, for instance, attendance records are generally set on a daily basis.
- Temporal Logic: Logic that temporal processing must adhere to, such as setting a configuration that during leave status, absence should be recorded as leave, not as absent.
- Temporal Field Names: Names specified for characteristic values during storage, retrieval, and statistical operations.

The temporal module requires completion of basic configuration in the static module before activation, such as configuring required temporal modules like attendance fields.

- Temporal Processing: Pertaining to the relevant content based on configured fields within the static module.
- Temporal Storage Process: Utilizing chain-based storage, this process responds in real-time to API call operations, storing data. At certain intervals based on system settings, data is encapsulated into a block and stored in the static chain, accompanied by head and tail hash values. The head hash value of the first block is the Unix timestamp of the creation time hashed, while the tail hash value should be the head hash value plus content hashed. Subsequent block's head hash value is the previous block's tail hash value.

The operation of information disclosure operates on articles as the smallest unit and encompasses overall content, hierarchically: articles, columns, sub-sites, and overall.

- Articles: Administrative personnel can write and publish articles.
- Columns: Administrative personnel can classify articles into created columns, and when a rendering program calls a specific column, it returns all articles formatted accordingly.
- Sub-sites: Administrative personnel can categorize columns into sub-sites, enabling unified configurations for cross-domain content, etc.
- Overall: All content falls under the overall category, and any editing at this level applies to all sub-items.

Once the configurations for information disclosure are completed, the system generates corresponding API calls. Technical personnel can write code to access relevant content, and the system provides Vue-based frontend and backend separate webpage templates for swift deployment.

Other functionalitiesï¼š

- Institutional Map: Enables the creation of an institutional map, allowing administrative personnel to set calibration points and place calibration QR codes at respective locations to guide new members or visitors regarding their positions and routes.

### IPAIMS for College

This version inherits all functionalities and logics from the Universal version and introduces the following presets based on actual requirements:

- Dynamic attendance based on course schedules, achieved through configuring temporal logics of temporal fields.
- Real-time dynamic leave management based on asset usage, dynamically and instantly calculating current expected personnel.
- Features for notification read checks and task completion status checks, established through configuring asset usage.
- Library book borrowing management achieved through configuring asset usage.
- Preset student management and faculty/staff management through configuring personnel group tables.
